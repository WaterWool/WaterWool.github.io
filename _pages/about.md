# ☀️ About Me
Welcome to my homepage! I’m Rungen Liu, a a first-year PhD studnet at City University of Hong Kong (CityU). Fortunately, I am supervised by [Prof. Xiangyu Zhao](https://zhaoxyai.github.io/) and [Prof. Jian Ma](https://www.cb.cityu.edu.hk/staff/isjian/), work and study in [AML Lab](https://aml-cityu.github.io/).
Before that, I graduated from Northeastern University (NEU) with a bachelor degree in Computer Science and Technology from School of Computer Science and Engineering supervised by [Prof. Gang Wu](http://faculty.neu.edu.cn/wugang/zh_CN/index.htm).<br />
My research interest includes Large Language Model Security, Recommendation System and Knowledge Graph.

**Online Editorial Display Platform for Knowledge Graph**<br/>
National-level Funded Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program (Excellent completion, only 2 groups in the College) [**Code**](https://github.com/WaterWool/An-online-editorial-display-platform-for-knowledge-graphs)<br/>
**Rungen Liu**, Ziao Qiu, Haowen Zheng, Jiaheng Wang, Tianshun Hong, Gang Wu<sup>#</sup>. 
- We develop the Platform for the users without relevant computer basics. It has a totally visualisation interface, you can generate nodes and relationships by simply drag and drop with your mouse. And there are also many features in it to help you quickly generate a knowledge graph as you like.
- **Output**:&nbsp;3 software copyrights

**Selective Image Encryption System Based on Semantic Understanding**<br/>
Deshui Yu, **Rungen Liu**, Yi Han, Zhijie Yan, Jiawei Li, Shan Si, Chong Fu<sup>#</sup>. [**Code**](https://github.com/yuyushui66/Selective-image-encryption-system-based-on-saliency-target)
- In this System, we design a salient target detection module based on the YOLO algorithm for accurate detection of cryptographic targets.
- We encrypt the target detection result using chaotic image encryption algorithm, which differs from traditional image encryption by simply encrypting blocks of pixels in the encrypted region.
- **Output**:&nbsp;Third prize in the National 2022 China University Computer Competition, first place in Northeast Region.
